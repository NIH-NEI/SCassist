# SCassist: An AI-Powered Workflow Assistant for Single-Cell Analysis

**SCassist** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to empower single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) researchers with intelligent insights and recommendations. The package leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to streamline the analysis workflow and guide decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient and interpretable results.

**Features:**

* **Quality Control and Filtering:** Analyze quality metrics using an LLM to recommend optimal filtering thresholds, ensuring only high-quality cells are included in downstream analysis.
* **Normalization:** Recommend the most appropriate normalization method for your data based on its characteristics and ensure data is normalized for downstream analysis.
* **Variable Feature Analysis:** Identify enriched biological pathways and ontologies among variable genes, providing insights into the processes driving cell-to-cell variation.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Analyze the top principal components (PCs) using an LLM to interpret the biological processes driving the variations captured by each PC.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Recommend the optimal number of PCs to use for downstream analysis (e.g., neighbor finding, UMAP) based on the variance explained.
* **Clustering:** Recommend a suitable range of resolution values for Seurat's `FindClusters` function, facilitating the identification of distinct cell populations.
* **Marker Gene Analysis and Cell Type Prediction:** Analyze top marker genes for each cluster using an LLM to predict potential cell types and provide reasoned explanations for the predictions.
* **KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis:** Analyze KEGG pathway enrichment results using an LLM to provide deeper insights into the enriched pathways, their relationships, and potential key genes or targets.

**Benefits:**

* **Automated Recommendations:** Receive tailored recommendations for key parameters and analysis choices based on your specific data characteristics.
* **LLM-Powered Insights:** Leverage the power of LLMs to interpret complex data, uncover hidden patterns, and generate insightful summaries and explanations.
* **Intuitive Interface:** Easy-to-use functions with clear documentation and examples, making advanced analysis accessible to researchers of all levels.

**Installation:**

```R
# Install the devtools package if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

# Install SCassist from GitHub
devtools::install_github("your-github-username/SCassist") 
```

**Example Usage:**

```R
# Load the SCassist package
library(SCassist)

# Load the example PBMC dataset
data("pbmc")

# Recommend normalization method
SCassist_recommend_normalization("pbmc")

# Analyze top variable features
SCassist_analyze_variable_features("pbmc", top_n_variable_features = 20)

# ...and many more functions!
```
